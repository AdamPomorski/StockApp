# StockApp

Simple application that provides user with information from stock market based on Alphavantage API. It was created based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLs2FxFSWU4">this</a> youtube tutorial with couple of adjusments such as caching locally the stock prices and some visuals. I also plan to develop some more features like providing similar interface for crypto market as well as displaying user portfolio.

# How to run

To run this project it is only required to add the field: API_KEY="<YOUR_ALPHANTAGE_KEY" to gradle.properties file and build the project. The api key is available for free <a href"https://www.alphavantage.co/">there</a>.
